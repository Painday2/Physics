	"phys_d2_b1_04_sub": "How's the framerate in there, chaps?",

	"phys_d2_b2_01_sub": "Onto business friends, search these shops for keycards. We'll need them to access the path to the top floor. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d2_b2_02_sub": "ANd uh, don't go muddling something giant with the computers, yeah? Just friendly advice. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d2_b3_01_sub": "What, you don't have all of the spawns memorized? The keycards are over there!",
	"phys_d2_b3_02_sub": "Fuck me, whats taking so long. The keycard is right there.",
	"phys_d2_b3_03_sub": "You haven't found the keycard yet, so I guess this is the first time playing this heist, yeah? It's over there,friends.",
			
	"phys_d2_b4_01_sub": "Keep moving up, friends!",

			
	"phys_d2_c1_01_sub": "I heard they were having some sort of audition for a payday movie here. Out looking for a giant 3D model I was told.",
	"phys_d2_c1_02_sub": "Maybe we can have a VR movie night when this is over, yeah?",

	"phys_d2_c3a_02_sub": "Yeah, you have fun trying to carry that back up you wanker.",
	"phys_d2_c3a_03_sub": "What? Did you expect some kind of secret when you did that?",
	"phys_d2_c3a_04_sub": "Ugh, you're an idiot.",
			
	"phys_d2_c4_01_sub": "Ah, kak. These VR puzzles are more advanced than I thought. Find some more things to throw at it.",
			
	"phys_d2_c5_01_sub": "That did the trick. Now, go upstairs.",
	"phys_d2_c5_02_sub": "Pain would have been proud of you. Now, proceed up the tower.",
	"phys_d2_c5_03_sub": "I bet you have some fun with these, yeah?",
	"phys_d2_c5_04_sub": "Huh, two toasts. Why didn't I think of that?",
			
	"phys_d2_d1_01_sub": "Alright, we're at the top floor. Now, before we get out of here. We need to find out what we're up against, and get some important info about Bo and StockOS. Like how strong he is, how much money he's worth. Oh, and how to enable the elevator so we can get out of there.",
	"phys_d2_d1_02_sub": "kak, looks like the elevator up ahead is fucking broken. Hack into one of the Overkill employees computers and see if I can get it working again.",
			
	"phys_d2_d2_01_sub": "Like I said, this bekakin elevator isn't working. Go and find a terminal so I can restart it. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d2_d2_02_sub": "Are you lots listening to Ol' Cocke? Get me a computer first.",
			
	"phys_d2_d3_01_sub": "Ah, so thats why Pain calls him a hard boiled turtle slapper. Ugh.",
	"phys_d2_d3_02_sub": "Oh. OH. Oh that is a lot of debt! Do any of the employees know about this?",
	"phys_d2_d3_03_sub": "Ah, no wonder this game runs so terribly.",
	"phys_d2_d3_04_sub": "Ah, keep looking friends.",
	"phys_d2_d3_05_sub": "Why would you bekakin record that! Ugh.",
	"phys_d2_d3_06_sub": "Uh, nothing on here. Keep searching.",
			
	"phys_d2_d4_01_sub": "Ah, something here. Now lets have a look. Bo Andersson Klint, partner of StockOS. Bro macho guy? Uh, just defend this computer from the kerrals while I dig through this.",
	"phys_d2_d4_02_sub": "Right, we're in. StockOS, main source of investment for Starbreeze AB. Powered by StarEnergy. Keep the kerrals off the computer while I work, yeah?",
			
	"phys_d2_d5_01_sub": "Right, I'm done. Let's get out of here.",

	"phys_d3_a2_01_sub": "There! Kill that son of a bitch.",
	"phys_d3_a2_02_sub": "That hard boiled turtle slapper! Get him!",
	"phys_d3_a2_03_sub": "Now this is going to be epic.",
			
	"phys_d3_b1_01_sub": "What? Thats it? Lucky I spent less than two hours in this bekakin game so I can still get us a refund. Use that computer go to help.steampowered.com click on 'Purchaces' select 'Boworks', then select 'I would like a refund'. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d3_b1_02_sub": "That's all? I can't believe I spent $29.99 on this scam. Hack his computer and I will request a refund for this stupid game. I'll even leave a negative review, that'll show them. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d3_b1_03_sub": "Wow, that sucked. I want my money back. We can still hit StockOS and make them bankrupt, Fo' Sho. All you need to do is hack Bo's computer and request a refund straight from the system.",
			
	"phys_d3_b2_01_sub": "Razing the bar for VR innovation in gaming? Yeah right, Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d3_b2_02_sub": "They're getting desperate to stop the refund at all costs! Pun intended. Hold them off, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b2_03_sub": "Did Overkill Jules design this game? No wonder it wasn't fun at all, that poe.",
	"phys_d3_b2_04_sub": "Did they seriously pick a racing engine to make this game? I'm sure that Valhalla engine they purchased earlier would have maked a better choice. Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d3_b2_05_sub": "Action packed? Check. 4 player? Check. Coop? Check. Fun? No check.",
	"phys_d3_b2_06_sub": "What a complete fucking overkill waste of time this was. I was expecting like a magnificent boss fight with explosions and giant Bo heads or some shit.",
			
	"phys_d3_b3_01_sub": "Kerrals stopped the refund process. Get it fixed, quickly.",
	"phys_d3_b3_02_sub": "Kak, my money stopped blowing back to my Steam wallet. Get back to that computer and keep it flowing.",
	"phys_d3_b3_03_sub": "Blerry, they got to the computer. I really need my money back, so get the refund going again. Fo' Sho.",
			
	"phys_d3_b4_01_sub": "Everyone disappeared for a minute, friends. What happened? Fo' Sho.",

	"phys_d3_b5_01_sub": "Got my refund! It was good playing with you, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b5_02_sub": "GG WP EZ. Now let's quit this game before it colapses on us, Fo' Sho.",
	"phys_d3_b5_03_sub": "Starbreeze shares are falling. Our work is done, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b5_04_sub": "Excelllent work gang, Fo' Sho. Wait, I feel like we're forgetting something.",
	"phys_d3_b5_05_sub": "We might not have rescued Pain but-Actually yeah we didn't rescue Pain, whoops!"
