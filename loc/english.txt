	"phys_d2_a2_01": "That big tower in the distance? Here we come.",
	"phys_d2_a2_02": "Now, make your way to that obviously tall tower. You can't miss it. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_a2_03": "Stop admiring the view! Get your asses inside that tower.",

	"phys_d2_b1_01": "Blerry, this place really showcases what VR is capable of.",
	"phys_d2_b1_02": "Ah, I've only seen screenshots on the Steam store page but, wow. Anyways, time to get to business.",
	"phys_d2_b1_03": "Nice, big...place. Starbreeze really spared no expense on this one. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_b1_04": "How's the framerate in there, chaps?",

	"phys_d2_b2_01": "Onto business friends. Search these shops for keycards. We'll need them to access the path to the top floor. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_b2_02": "And, uh, don't go modeling something giant with the computers, yeah? Just friendly advice. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_b3_01": "What, you don't have all the spawns memorized? The keycards are over there!",
	"phys_d2_b3_02": "Fuck me, what's taking so long. The keycard is right there!",
	"phys_d2_b3_03": "You haven't found the keycard yet, so I guess it's your first time playing this heist, yeah? It's over there, friends.",
			
	"phys_d2_b4_01": "Keep moving up, friends!",

			
	"phys_d2_c1_01": "I heard they were having some sort of audition for a PAYDAY movie here. Something involving giant 3D models, I was told.",
	"phys_d2_c1_02": "I know they're planning to show something that isn't suitable for younger audiences in this theater.",
	"phys_d2_c1_03": "Maybe we can have a VR movie night when this is over, yeah?",
	"phys_d2_c1_04": "Heard of Andreas's latest movie? A giant blockbuster, fo' sho!",

			
	"phys_d2_c2_01": "Ah, you should be familiar with these.",

	"phys_d2_c3_01": "What a comically large toast. It must have been made with an equally comically large toaster. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_c3_02": "Ah, our StockOS Weighted Sustenance Toast. Don't worry! It won't threaten to stab you, and in fact cannot speak. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_c3_03": "You had fun carrying this around in the White Xmas job, yeah? This Almir fellow really enjoys throwing jokes everywhere. Fo' sho.",

	"phys_d2_c3a_01": "Nice fucking throw, dingus.",
	"phys_d2_c3a_02": "Yeah, you have fun trying to carry that back up you wanker.",
	"phys_d2_c3a_03": "What? Did you expect some kind of secret when you did that?",
	"phys_d2_c3a_04": "Ugh, you're an idiot.",
			
	"phys_d2_c4_01": "Ah, kak. These VR puzzles are more advanced than I thought. Find some more things to throw at it.",
			
	"phys_d2_c5_01": "That did the trick. Now, go upstairs.",
	"phys_d2_c5_02": "Pain would have been proud of you. Now, proceed up the tower.",
	"phys_d2_c5_03": "I bet you had some fun with these, yeah?",
	"phys_d2_c5_04": "Huh, two toasts. Why didn't I think of that?",
			
	"phys_d2_d1_01": "Alright, we're at the top floor. Now, before we get out of here, we need to find out what we're up against, and get some important info about Bo and StockOS. Like how strong he is, how much money he's worth. Oh, and how to enable the elevator so we can get out of there.",
	"phys_d2_d1_02": "Kak, looks like the elevator up ahead is fucking broken. Hack into some of the Overkill employees' computers and see if I can get it working again.",
			
	"phys_d2_d2_01": "Like I said, this bekakin elevator isn't working. Go and find a terminal so I can restart it. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_d2_02": "Are you lots listening to ol' Cocke? Get me a computer first.",
			
	"phys_d2_d3_01": "Ah, so that's why Pain calls him a hard boiled turtle slapper. Ugh.",
	"phys_d2_d3_02": "Oh. OH. Oh that is a lot of debt! Do any of the employees know about this?",
	"phys_d2_d3_03": "Ah, no wonder this game runs so terribly.",
	"phys_d2_d3_04": "Ah, keep looking friends.",
	"phys_d2_d3_05": "W-why would you bekakin record that! Ugh.",
	"phys_d2_d3_06": "Uh, nothing on here. Keep searching.",
			
	"phys_d2_d4_01": "Ah, something here. Now let's have a look. Bo Andersson Klint, partner of StockOS. Bro macho guy? Uh, just defend this computer from the kerels while I dig through this.",
	"phys_d2_d4_02": "Right, we're in. StockOS, main source of investment for Starbreeze AB. Powered by StarEnergy. Keep the kerels off the computer while I work, yeah?",
			
	"phys_d2_d5_01": "Right, I'm done. Let's get out of here.",
	"phys_d2_d5_02": "Get to the elevator, let's finish this. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_d5_03": "Hang on Pain, we're coming to rescue you. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_d5_04": "Bo won't know what hit him, heh? Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d2_d5_05": "You guys are a natural at VR, yeah? Fo' sho.",		

	"phys_d3_a1_01": "That elevator will take you up to the main offices. So go up there.",
	"phys_d3_a1_02": "Are you guys ready? Take that elevator, and face that kerel.",
	"phys_d3_a1_03": "Next floor is the main office where Bo resides. Friends, let's do this. Fo' sho.",
			
	"phys_d3_a2_01": "There! Kill that son of a bitch!",
	"phys_d3_a2_02": "That hard boiled turtle slapper! Get him!",
	"phys_d3_a2_03": "Now this, is going to be epic.",
			
	"phys_d3_b1_01": "W-what? That's it? Ah, lucky I spent less than two hours in this bekakin game so I can still request a refund. Use that computer, go to help.steampowered.com, click on 'Purchases', select 'Boworks', then select 'I would like a refund'. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d3_b1_02": "That's all? I can't believe I spent $29.99 on this scam. Hack his computer and I'll request a refund for this stupid game. I'll even leave a negative review. That'll show them, fo' sho.",
	"phys_d3_b1_03": "Wow, that sucked. I want my money back. We can still hit StockOS and make them bankrupt, for real. Fo' sho! All you need to do is hack Bo's computer and request a refund straight from the system.",
			
	"phys_d3_b2_01": "Raising the bar for innovation in VR gaming? Yeah, right, Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d3_b2_02": "They're getting desperate to stop the refund at all costs! Pun intended. Hold them off, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b2_03": "Did OVERKILL_Jules design this game? No wonder it wasn't fun at all, that poe.",
	"phys_d3_b2_04": "Did they seriously pick a racing engine to make this game? I'm sure that Valhalla engine they purchased earlier would have been a much better choice. Fo' sho.",
	"phys_d3_b2_05": "Action packed? Check. Four player? Check. Coop? Check. Fun? No check.",
	"phys_d3_b2_06": "What a complete fucking overkill waste of time this was. I was expecting like, a magnificent boss fight with explosions and giant Bo heads or some shit.",
			
	"phys_d3_b3_01": "Kerels stopped the refund process. Get it fixed, quickly!",
	"phys_d3_b3_02": "Kak, my money stopped flowing back to my Steam wallet. Get back to that computer and keep it flowing.",
	"phys_d3_b3_03": "Blerry, they got to the computer! I really need my money back, so get the refund going again. Fo' sho.",
			
	"phys_d3_b4_01": "Everyone disappeared for a minute, friends. What happened? Fo' sho.",

	"phys_d3_b5_01": "Got my refund! It was good playing with you, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b5_02": "GG WP EZ. Now let's quit this game before it collapses on us, fo' sho.",
	"phys_d3_b5_03": "Starbreeze shares are falling. Our work is done, friends.",
	"phys_d3_b5_04": "Excellent work gang, fo' sho. Wait, I feel like we're forgetting something.",
	"phys_d3_b5_05": "We might not have rescued Pain but...actually yeah we didn't rescue Pain. Whoops!"
